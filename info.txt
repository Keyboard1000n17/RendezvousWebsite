What It Means to Be Environmentally Friendly

Being eco friendly means living in a way that is not harmful to the environment. This way of life is becoming increasingly important, as we must protect our planet from damage that we cause. Many ways in various areas are there for an individual to make sustainable changes to decrease the negative effects our daily lives usually contribute to.

The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> continues to issue severe warnings of the failure of governments and systems to suitably react to the rapidly changing climate, which continues to rip through the poorest areas of the world, displacing more than 20 million people each year and intensifying global supply-demand dynamics.

The seismic shift required to circumvent further worsening of the effects of climate change will require action from individuals on a community level. This could include energy-based home improvements or reducing over-consumption. Currently, emissions from consumption in high-income cities are set to double by 2050. This must be urgently reduced by two-thirds by 2030 to ensure the health and happiness of future generations.

This website spans various areas of your life where you can change your routines and reconsider your engagement with the systems around you. From small energy efficiency measures to energy system upgrades, from realising your purchasing power to adopting eco tourism habits. Making a start and having an awareness of personal changes that you can make can contribute towards system change and improve your local community.

It is possible to be eco friendly in various areas of our lives.

Here's a quick list of how to be eco-friendly if one doesn't want to spend too long browsing here, but these tips are quite general.

Use LED lighting throughout your home. 
Use more public transport. 
Wash your clothes less often.
Eat less meat.
Limit plane travel.
Change pension supplier.
Invest in electronic devices instead of paper.
Keep reading to learn more about applying these changes to your everyday life and to get more actionable tips to apply to these areas.



Wash Your Clothes Less
Synthetic material sheds microplastics in the washing machine, which reach the ocean. The ocean floor holds over 14 million tonnes of microplastics. This number is increasing, with textiles contributing 500,000 tonnes yearly. 16% of the microplastics released into the oceans come from washing these synthetic clothes. The toxic fibres degrade ecosystems and are ingested by sea life and, eventually, mammals, including humans.

Overwashing your clothes at high temperatures will also affect their quality over time. It’s also a great waste of water and energy from your washing machine. Also, be sure only to buy non-toxic detergents and avoid the use/overuse of tumble dryers.

Don’t Throw Wearable Clothes Away
The UK produces around 1 million tonnes of textile waste per year. Once in a landfill, they can take hundreds of years to decompose and release greenhouse gases (GHG).

Ultra-fast fashion, a mutation of fast fashion, has emerged as online clothing stores produce and release thousands of new items daily. Participating in these rapid trend cycles is creating a culture of over-consumerism.

You can make easy alterations and repairs to your clothing to keep them longer or adjust to current trends. Vintage and second-hand outlets will offer more affordable alternative options, often based on the same clothing items.

If you want some new clothing, be sure it’s of good quality and lasts a long time. You can also research sustainable brands that limit the impact of production and are transparent about their supply chains.

Open gaps and seams, called air leaks, allow cold or warm air from outside to enter your home through window frames, exterior doors, uninsulated rim joists, your attic, and more. Air sealing fixes this issue. Along with insulation, air sealing is one of the most important things you can do to improve your home’s comfort, health, and energy efficiency—but it’s often overlooked by both homeowners and even some contractors. Air sealing is the process of locating—and then sealing—all the nooks, crannies, gaps, and open seams throughout your home. A professionally-sealed home will have well-regulated air flow — it’ll be less stuffy in summer and less drafty in winter. Air sealing can also improve your home’s overall air quality, reduce humidity in your house, increase the health and comfort of your home, reduce the energy used by your heating and cooling equipment and lower your energy bills.

[energystar.gov/saveathome/heating-cooling/duct-sealing]

In houses with forced-air heating and cooling systems, ducts are used to distribute conditioned air throughout the house. In a typical house, however, about 20 to 30 percent of the air that moves through the duct system is lost due to leaks, holes, and poorly connected ducts. The result is higher utility bills and difficulty keeping the house comfortable, no matter how the thermostat is set.

How do you know that your home has poorly performing ducts?

you have high summer and winter utility bills;
you have rooms that are difficult to heat and cool;
you have stuffy rooms that never seem to feel comfortable;
your ducts are located in an attic, crawlspace, or the garage;
you find tangled or kinked flexible ducts in your system.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
[https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/heating-cooling/duct-sealing/benefits]

A duct system that is well-designed and properly sealed can make your home more comfortable, energy efficient, and safer.

Comfort: Sealing and insulating ducts can help with common comfort problems, such as rooms that are too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter.

Indoor air quality: Fumes from household and garden chemicals, insulation particles, and dust can enter your duct system, aggravating asthma and allergy problems. Sealing ducts can help improve indoor air quality by reducing the risk of pollutants entering ducts and circulating through your home.

Safety: During normal operation, gas appliances such as water heaters, clothes dryers, and furnaces release combustion gases (like carbon monoxide) through their ventilation systems. Leaky ductwork in your heating and cooling system may cause “backdrafting,” where these gases are drawn back into the living space, rather than expelled to the outdoors. Sealing leaks can minimize this risk.

Save money: Leaky ducts can reduce heating and cooling system efficiency by as much as 20 percent. Sealing and insulating ducts increases efficiency, lowers your energy bills, and can often pay for itself in energy savings. Plus, if you’re planning to install new heating and cooling equipment, a well-designed and sealed duct system may allow you to downsize to a smaller, less costly heating and cooling system that will provide better dehumidification.

Protect the environment: Energy used in our homes often comes from the burning of fossil fuels at power plants, which contributes to smog, acid rain, and climate change. Simply put, the less energy we use in our homes, the less air pollution we generate. By sealing your ducts and reducing the amount of energy necessary to comfortably heat or cool your home, you can reduce the amount of air pollution generated.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Sealing ducts can also help improve the indoor air quality by reducing the risks of pollutants entering ducts from dusty attics or musty crawlspaces and circulating through your home. Dust from insulation particles or smells from damp spaces could aggravate asthma and allergy problems.

Peace of Mind: The less energy you use in your home,
the less air pollution is produced. By sealing your ducts
and reducing the amount of energy necessary to
comfortably heat or cool your home, you can have the peace of
mind that you’ve done the right thing for your family, home, and
for the planet.

Choosing eco-friendly transportation is crucial for reducing our environmental impact. Today, there are multiple sustainable transportation options that allow us to get around with a lower ecological footprint, from electric cars to bicycles and efficient public transport. These methods are not only good for the planet, but also offer personal benefits such as reduced traffic stress, long-term savings, and improved health. Switching to eco-friendly transportation is not just a smart choice for the environment, but also for your personal well-being. Choosing eco-friendly transportation reduces traffic, improves health, and can lead to significant savings. Whether cycling, walking, or using electric transport, every small change helps make the world a cleaner, healthier place for everyone.

As we further our awareness of the environmental impact of our choices, how we travel has become an important consideration. Electric vehicles are transforming the way we commute, providing a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to traditional gas-powered cars. Besides electric cars, bicycles are not only a fun and healthy option but also an excellent way to reduce our carbon footprint. Also, modern public transportation systems are evolving to better meet the needs of urban populations, offering an affordable and eco-friendly way to get around. Whether you’re travelling by bus, train, or tram, these systems are leading the way toward more sustainable and eco-friendly mobility. It is very easy to implement some of these methods of transportation - even walking to the grocery store 5 streets over reduces your carbon footprint.

Here is a list of eco-friendly ways to move around:

1. Walking or Cycling
Opting to walk or cycle is not only environmentally friendly but also a fantastic way to infuse physical activity into your daily routine, promoting a healthier lifestyle. These modes of transportation are perfect for short distances, allowing you to connect with your surroundings and enjoy the scenery while reducing your carbon footprint.

2. Public Transport
If your destination is a bit farther, consider utilizing public transportation like the subway or bus. While it might require a bit more planning than driving, public transit significantly reduces carbon emissions by consolidating passengers into fewer vehicles, thereby contributing to a cleaner environment. Qatar has the Karwa network, which you can use to get around.

3. Carpooling
Sharing rides with coworkers or friends heading in the same direction as you is a great way to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Not only does carpooling contribute to environmental conservation by cutting down individual carbon footprints, but it also builds community and helps in cost-saving for all involved. Just convince one person, it can make an impact.

4. Electric Cars and Trucks
Consider opting for an electric vehicle (EV) if you require a personal vehicle for your trips. Electric cars, powered by electricity rather than traditional gasoline or diesel, are gaining popularity due to their eco-friendliness, offering an efficient alternative that significantly reduces carbon emissions and air pollution. In the realm of freight and cargo transportation, transitioning from traditional fuel-based trucks to electric ones makes a substantial impact. Electric trucks greatly diminish carbon emissions during the transportation of goods, playing a pivotal role in environmental preservation and the ongoing battle against climate change. While quite expensive, they greatly reduce your carbon footprint. But no worries if you can't afford one, you don't have to make the biggest impact. These other methods are easily available!

5. Electric scooters
Electric scooters are a practical and environmentally friendly option for short trips in urban environments. Their electric nature makes them an efficient mode of transportation that helps reduce pollution and carbon emissions in urban areas. Moreover, their versatility and ease of use make them ideal for short journeys, providing an agile and sustainable alternative for getting around the city. If you aren't exactly willing to walk 5 streets over, one of these, which you can find for around 1000 QAR here, could save you time and energy, as well as save the planet from some carbon dioxide and gases produced by cars.

6. Rail Transportation
Trains and railway systems, especially those powered by electricity, are an excellent choice for longer trips. They are highly efficient and emit less carbon per passenger compared to other modes of transportation. In Qatar exists a well-known metro network in many areas called Qatar Metro. It is divided into the Red Line, Green Line and Gold Line, spanning across a total of 37 stations.

Transport carries multiple opportunities to exert a less harmful impact on the environment. In a world in which consumers are becoming more climate-conscious, anything the transportation world can do to protect the planet as human beings or businesses go about their activities is welcome.

It’s a big question, but thankfully, it’s one for which there are plenty of answers. There’s still time for the planet. Below are some suggested ways that we can make transport more sustainable.

Decide what sustainability means for cities
Sustainable transport can mean a variety of things, depending on the location in which it’s being implemented. It could create scope for a better quality of life for the citizens. It could mean working towards a more functional but green city. It could even mean bridging an inequality gap.

Defining what sustainable transport will be like in a city requires the consideration of questions such as:

Will wider pavements be necessary?
Will there be a need for more cycle lanes?
Will the public system require more buses?
Will residents be able to access the buses (or other forms of transportation in the city)?

It's indisputable that sustainability has become an important aspect for businesses. Consumers want to buy from companies that operate in an eco-friendly way.

As consumers, we often find ourselves entangled in a web of fleeting styles where the pursuit of quantity overshadows the importance of quality. This relentless pursuit leads to overflowing closets, paradoxically leaving us feeling like we have ‘nothing to wear.’ However, a transformative shift in perspective towards valuing the intrinsic worth and longevity of clothing can bring about significant change.

Opting for quality over quantity results in versatile and stylish wardrobes and aligns with sustainability and economic sensibility. This conscious approach promotes thoughtful consumption, reduces waste, and fosters a more symbiotic relationship with our garments.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Shopping second-hand is one of the easiest ways to reduce the impact clothes have on the environment. When we purchase second-hand clothing and accessories, we reduce the demand for new clothing. This reduces the resources, pesticides, and fertilizers needed to produce it. As a result, carbon emissions and pollution decrease. 

Buying second-hand clothing can also save money, allow you to find unique pieces, and support local communities by purchasing from second-hand stores or organizations, such as <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/">Housing Works</a>, which contributes to important causes like fighting AIDS, homelessness, and social justice.

Next time you need to update your wardrobe, consider shopping second-hand and make a positive impact on the environment and your community.

Do you have a closet full of clothes that you no longer wear? Instead of throwing items away, consider selling them to give your wardrobe a second chance at life. There are various options for selling clothing online, including Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Poshmark, and ThredUp. These online marketplaces allow you to list your clothes for sale and reach a broad audience of potential buyers. 

Laundry may not be at the forefront of your mind when considering sustainability though there are many ways to make your laundry habits more eco-friendly. Certain chemicals and energy used in traditional laundry practices can significantly impact the environment. One simple change is to switch to an eco-friendly detergent. These detergents are made from natural ingredients and are biodegradable, making them less harmful to the environment and your skin.

Another option is to use an organic dry cleaner. Many traditional dry cleaners use harsh chemicals. Organic dry cleaners use safer, non-toxic cleaning methods that are better for the environment and your health. Not only will you be reducing your environmental impact, but you'll also be supporting a more sustainable business.
