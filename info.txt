What It Means to Be Environmentally Friendly

Being eco friendly means living in a way that is not harmful to the environment. This way of life is becoming increasingly important, as we must protect our planet from damage that we cause. Many ways in various areas are there for an individual to make sustainable changes to decrease the negative effects our daily lives usually contribute to.

The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> continues to issue severe warnings of the failure of governments and systems to suitably react to the rapidly changing climate, which continues to rip through the poorest areas of the world, displacing more than 20 million people each year and intensifying global supply-demand dynamics.

The seismic shift required to circumvent further worsening of the effects of climate change will require action from individuals on a community level. This could include energy-based home improvements or reducing over-consumption. Currently, emissions from consumption in high-income cities are set to double by 2050. This must be urgently reduced by two-thirds by 2030 to ensure the health and happiness of future generations.

This website spans various areas of your life where you can change your routines and reconsider your engagement with the systems around you. From small energy efficiency measures to energy system upgrades, from realising your purchasing power to adopting eco tourism habits. Making a start and having an awareness of personal changes that you can make can contribute towards system change and improve your local community.

It is possible to be eco friendly in various areas of our lives.

Here's a quick list of how to be eco-friendly if one doesn't want to spend too long browsing here, but these tips are quite general.

Use LED lighting throughout your home. 
Use more public transport. 
Wash your clothes less often.
Eat less meat.
Limit plane travel.
Change pension supplier.
Invest in electronic devices instead of paper.
Keep reading to learn more about applying these changes to your everyday life and to get more actionable tips to apply to these areas.



Wash Your Clothes Less
Synthetic material sheds microplastics in the washing machine, which reach the ocean. The ocean floor holds over 14 million tonnes of microplastics. This number is increasing, with textiles contributing 500,000 tonnes yearly. 16% of the microplastics released into the oceans come from washing these synthetic clothes. The toxic fibres degrade ecosystems and are ingested by sea life and, eventually, mammals, including humans.

Overwashing your clothes at high temperatures will also affect their quality over time. It’s also a great waste of water and energy from your washing machine. Also, be sure only to buy non-toxic detergents and avoid the use/overuse of tumble dryers.

Don’t Throw Wearable Clothes Away
The UK produces around 1 million tonnes of textile waste per year. Once in a landfill, they can take hundreds of years to decompose and release greenhouse gases (GHG).

Ultra-fast fashion, a mutation of fast fashion, has emerged as online clothing stores produce and release thousands of new items daily. Participating in these rapid trend cycles is creating a culture of over-consumerism.

You can make easy alterations and repairs to your clothing to keep them longer or adjust to current trends. Vintage and second-hand outlets will offer more affordable alternative options, often based on the same clothing items.

If you want some new clothing, be sure it’s of good quality and lasts a long time. You can also research sustainable brands that limit the impact of production and are transparent about their supply chains.

The toxic fibres degrade ecosystems and are ingested by sea life and, eventually, mammals, including humans.

Shop for Local Produce
The average item of fresh food travels 1,500 miles before we buy it. These carbon-heavy value chains create emissions through transport, refrigeration and production processes.

You can eliminate this by buying from local producers where you can. A well-established local food economy strengthens supply chains, meaning there are more supply options during shortages. Local, seasonal produce also has higher nutritional value since it has spent less time from its source. Meanwhile, international produce is grown to artificially exceed its natural shelf life, which compromises its nutritional value.

You can limit your household food waste by portioning your meals reasonably, only buying what you need and using food waste as fertiliser for soil and plants.


Cruise holidays have become increasingly popular. However, these big ships contribute massively to GHG emissions. Carnival Corporation's fleet of 47 cruise ships emits 10 times more sulphur oxides (SOx) than 100 million cars.

It is important to be aware of your holiday's footprint on the environment and opt for more sustainable holidays when possible.

26. Practice Sustainable Tourism
Following the pandemic, people have become more aware of their cultural, economic and environmental impacts as tourists, with 72% of people surveyed by Booking.com admitting that they think sustainable travel is vital.

Increasingly, people are engaging more in sustainable tourism, which involves limiting their carbon footprint while travelling, being tactical with their spending power and helping sustain the natural environment they have the privilege to visit.

This helps prevent over-tourism, which is the overcrowding of tourist destinations that disrupts the local way of life through the rise in housing and renting costs and the commodification of local traditions.

Pollution, especially through excess waste, leads to the degradation of natural or archaeological sites and the depletion of natural resources, including water, soil nutrients and biodiversity.

Below are just some eco-tourism tips to consider for your next trip:

Reusable Bottle
Choose tour operators that invest in the local communities where they conduct their business
Travel off-season
Choose less tourist-heavy locations
Don’t litter
Use public transport as much as possible
Stick to footpaths
Use reusable containers and bottles rather than disposable paper plates, cutlery and cups
Limit your energy use in accommodation such as by taking shorter showers, reducing air-conditioning use
Spend in local shops and restaurants
Use Environmentally Friendly Travel Products

Green Key Certified Accommodation
Looking for the most sustainable places in their business is important when looking for accommodation abroad. Selecting Green Key-certified accommodation is one way to do that.

To be Green Key certified, 13 criteria need to be fulfilled. Being Green Key certified means that the accommodation respects local cultures and traditions, takes care of the environment and treats its employees fairly.

28. Unplug Before Travelling
Even if electronic devices are shut off or in sleep mode, they still use energy. Being away for too long wastes energy that could otherwise have been plugged off. So, before going on vacation, unplug your devices from the wall sockets to save electricity.

Each UK household spends around £50 – £86 a year to power appliances left in standby mode or unused.

Unplug All Electric Devices Before Travelling
29. Pack Light
Flying to foreign destinations will emit emissions no matter what. However, if flying is the only option, then travellers can try to pack light to minimise pollution. The more luggage a plane carries on its travels, the more fuel the aeroplane needs to fly.

30. Give Away Perishable Food Items before Travelling
Before leaving for vacation, check if any food item in the fridge is about to expire. If possible, consume it before the expiry date; otherwise, donate it to needy people and avoid food wastage.

Encourage Public Transportation for Employees
Depending on the distance from the employee’s home to the workplace, there are different ways to commute to work. While using a car may seem the easiest and fastest option, taking the train or bus would pollute less. You could ride a bicycle to work depending on your city's biking infrastructure.

Encourage the Mantra ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’
hese three well-known waste management principles will make your office more eco friendly. Obvious? Maybe. But it helps. Offices should set up different containers for different types of products. Use recycling bins for paper, plastic, and soft drink cans rather than throwing everything out in one bin.

Use Electricity Wisely
Offices naturally require electricity to power their equipment, amenities, and facilities. However, knowing about energy consumption and what is required is important.

Companies could contribute to a greener office by ensuring that electric devices are plugged off when not in use. It's good to stay aware of energy consumption and to make changes when the usage is predicted to go above the limit set for the month.

Moreover, an increasing number of large tech corporations are using green energy to meet their electricity needs.

Open gaps and seams, called air leaks, allow cold or warm air from outside to enter your home through window frames, exterior doors, uninsulated rim joists, your attic, and more. Air sealing fixes this issue. Along with insulation, air sealing is one of the most important things you can do to improve your home’s comfort, health, and energy efficiency—but it’s often overlooked by both homeowners and even some contractors. Air sealing is the process of locating—and then sealing—all the nooks, crannies, gaps, and open seams throughout your home. A professionally-sealed home will have well-regulated air flow — it’ll be less stuffy in summer and less drafty in winter. Air sealing can also improve your home’s overall air quality, reduce humidity in your house, increase the health and comfort of your home, reduce the energy used by your heating and cooling equipment and lower your energy bills.

[energystar.gov/saveathome/heating-cooling/duct-sealing]

In houses with forced-air heating and cooling systems, ducts are used to distribute conditioned air throughout the house. In a typical house, however, about 20 to 30 percent of the air that moves through the duct system is lost due to leaks, holes, and poorly connected ducts. The result is higher utility bills and difficulty keeping the house comfortable, no matter how the thermostat is set.

How do you know that your home has poorly performing ducts?

you have high summer and winter utility bills;
you have rooms that are difficult to heat and cool;
you have stuffy rooms that never seem to feel comfortable;
your ducts are located in an attic, crawlspace, or the garage;
you find tangled or kinked flexible ducts in your system.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
[https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/heating-cooling/duct-sealing/benefits]

A duct system that is well-designed and properly sealed can make your home more comfortable, energy efficient, and safer.

Comfort: Sealing and insulating ducts can help with common comfort problems, such as rooms that are too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter.

Indoor air quality: Fumes from household and garden chemicals, insulation particles, and dust can enter your duct system, aggravating asthma and allergy problems. Sealing ducts can help improve indoor air quality by reducing the risk of pollutants entering ducts and circulating through your home.

Safety: During normal operation, gas appliances such as water heaters, clothes dryers, and furnaces release combustion gases (like carbon monoxide) through their ventilation systems. Leaky ductwork in your heating and cooling system may cause “backdrafting,” where these gases are drawn back into the living space, rather than expelled to the outdoors. Sealing leaks can minimize this risk.

Save money: Leaky ducts can reduce heating and cooling system efficiency by as much as 20 percent. Sealing and insulating ducts increases efficiency, lowers your energy bills, and can often pay for itself in energy savings. Plus, if you’re planning to install new heating and cooling equipment, a well-designed and sealed duct system may allow you to downsize to a smaller, less costly heating and cooling system that will provide better dehumidification.

Protect the environment: Energy used in our homes often comes from the burning of fossil fuels at power plants, which contributes to smog, acid rain, and climate change. Simply put, the less energy we use in our homes, the less air pollution we generate. By sealing your ducts and reducing the amount of energy necessary to comfortably heat or cool your home, you can reduce the amount of air pollution generated.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Sealing ducts can also help improve the indoor air quality by reducing the risks of pollutants entering ducts from dusty attics or musty crawlspaces and circulating through your home. Dust from insulation particles or smells from damp spaces could aggravate asthma and allergy problems.

Peace of Mind: The less energy you use in your home,
the less air pollution is produced. By sealing your ducts
and reducing the amount of energy necessary to
comfortably heat or cool your home, you can have the peace of
mind that you’ve done the right thing for your family, home, and
for the planet.

Choosing eco-friendly transportation is crucial for reducing our environmental impact. Today, there are multiple sustainable transportation options that allow us to get around with a lower ecological footprint, from electric cars to bicycles and efficient public transport. These methods are not only good for the planet, but also offer personal benefits such as reduced traffic stress, long-term savings, and improved health. Switching to eco-friendly transportation is not just a smart choice for the environment, but also for your personal well-being. Choosing eco-friendly transportation reduces traffic, improves health, and can lead to significant savings. Whether cycling, walking, or using electric transport, every small change helps make the world a cleaner, healthier place for everyone.

As we further our awareness of the environmental impact of our choices, how we travel has become an important consideration. Electric vehicles are transforming the way we commute, providing a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to traditional gas-powered cars. Besides electric cars, bicycles are not only a fun and healthy option but also an excellent way to reduce our carbon footprint. Also, modern public transportation systems are evolving to better meet the needs of urban populations, offering an affordable and eco-friendly way to get around. Whether you’re travelling by bus, train, or tram, these systems are leading the way toward more sustainable and eco-friendly mobility. It is very easy to implement some of these methods of transportation - even walking to the grocery store 5 streets over reduces your carbon footprint.

Here is a list of eco-friendly ways to move around:

1. Walking or Cycling
Opting to walk or cycle is not only environmentally friendly but also a fantastic way to infuse physical activity into your daily routine, promoting a healthier lifestyle. These modes of transportation are perfect for short distances, allowing you to connect with your surroundings and enjoy the scenery while reducing your carbon footprint.

2. Public Transport
If your destination is a bit farther, consider utilizing public transportation like the subway or bus. While it might require a bit more planning than driving, public transit significantly reduces carbon emissions by consolidating passengers into fewer vehicles, thereby contributing to a cleaner environment. Qatar has the Karwa network, which you can use to get around.

3. Carpooling
Sharing rides with coworkers or friends heading in the same direction as you is a great way to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. Not only does carpooling contribute to environmental conservation by cutting down individual carbon footprints, but it also builds community and helps in cost-saving for all involved. Just convince one person, it can make an impact.

4. Electric Cars and Trucks
Consider opting for an electric vehicle (EV) if you require a personal vehicle for your trips. Electric cars, powered by electricity rather than traditional gasoline or diesel, are gaining popularity due to their eco-friendliness, offering an efficient alternative that significantly reduces carbon emissions and air pollution. In the realm of freight and cargo transportation, transitioning from traditional fuel-based trucks to electric ones makes a substantial impact. Electric trucks greatly diminish carbon emissions during the transportation of goods, playing a pivotal role in environmental preservation and the ongoing battle against climate change. While quite expensive, they greatly reduce your carbon footprint. But no worries if you can't afford one, you don't have to make the biggest impact. These other methods are easily available!

5. Electric scooters
Electric scooters are a practical and environmentally friendly option for short trips in urban environments. Their electric nature makes them an efficient mode of transportation that helps reduce pollution and carbon emissions in urban areas. Moreover, their versatility and ease of use make them ideal for short journeys, providing an agile and sustainable alternative for getting around the city. If you aren't exactly willing to walk 5 streets over, one of these, which you can find for around 1000 QAR here, could save you time and energy, as well as save the planet from some carbon dioxide and gases produced by cars.

6. Rail Transportation
Trains and railway systems, especially those powered by electricity, are an excellent choice for longer trips. They are highly efficient and emit less carbon per passenger compared to other modes of transportation. In Qatar exists a well-known metro network in many areas called Qatar Metro. It is divided into the Red Line, Green Line and Gold Line, spanning across a total of 37 stations.

Transport carries multiple opportunities to exert a less harmful impact on the environment. In a world in which consumers are becoming more climate-conscious, anything the transportation world can do to protect the planet as human beings or businesses go about their activities is welcome.

It’s a big question, but thankfully, it’s one for which there are plenty of answers. There’s still time for the planet. Below are some suggested ways that we can make transport more sustainable.

Decide what sustainability means for cities
Sustainable transport can mean a variety of things, depending on the location in which it’s being implemented. It could create scope for a better quality of life for the citizens. It could mean working towards a more functional but green city. It could even mean bridging an inequality gap.

Defining what sustainable transport will be like in a city requires the consideration of questions such as:

Will wider pavements be necessary?
Will there be a need for more cycle lanes?
Will the public system require more buses?
Will residents be able to access the buses (or other forms of transportation in the city)?

It's indisputable that sustainability has become an important aspect for businesses. Consumers want to buy from companies that operate in an eco-friendly way.

As consumers, we often find ourselves entangled in a web of fleeting styles where the pursuit of quantity overshadows the importance of quality. This relentless pursuit leads to overflowing closets, paradoxically leaving us feeling like we have ‘nothing to wear.’ However, a transformative shift in perspective towards valuing the intrinsic worth and longevity of clothing can bring about significant change.

Opting for quality over quantity results in versatile and stylish wardrobes and aligns with sustainability and economic sensibility. This conscious approach promotes thoughtful consumption, reduces waste, and fosters a more symbiotic relationship with our garments.

Shopping second-hand is one of the easiest ways to reduce the impact clothes have on the environment. When we purchase second-hand clothing and accessories, we reduce the demand for new clothing. This reduces the resources, pesticides, and fertilizers needed to produce it. As a result, carbon emissions and pollution decrease. 

Buying second-hand clothing can also save money, allow you to find unique pieces, and support local communities by purchasing from second-hand stores or organizations, such as <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/">Housing Works</a>, which contributes to important causes like fighting AIDS, homelessness, and social justice.

Next time you need to update your wardrobe, consider shopping second-hand and make a positive impact on the environment and your community.

Do you have a closet full of clothes that you no longer wear? Instead of throwing items away, consider selling them to give your wardrobe a second chance at life. There are various options for selling clothing online, including Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Poshmark, and ThredUp. These online marketplaces allow you to list your clothes for sale and reach a broad audience of potential buyers. 

Laundry may not be at the forefront of your mind when considering sustainability though there are many ways to make your laundry habits more eco-friendly. Certain chemicals and energy used in traditional laundry practices can significantly impact the environment. One simple change is to switch to an eco-friendly detergent. These detergents are made from natural ingredients and are biodegradable, making them less harmful to the environment and your skin.

Another option is to use an organic dry cleaner. Many traditional dry cleaners use harsh chemicals. Organic dry cleaners use safer, non-toxic cleaning methods that are better for the environment and your health. Not only will you be reducing your environmental impact, but you'll also be supporting a more sustainable business.

What we eat has changed the planet. Across the globe forests have been devastated to make space to rear cattle and to grow crops to feed livestock, while our oceans become barren as they are trawled and overfished. Food production is not only the greatest driver of wildlife loss, it contributes to climate change: about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food.

Food waste is a big problem. 30% of the food produced is wasted, with serious repercussions for the environment. In fact, if food waste was a country it would be the 3rd largest emitter of greenhouse gasses after China and the USA.  Reducing waste in your household is simple: freeze anything you can’t eat while it’s fresh and, where possible, buy loose produce so you can select the exact amount that you need.

You can also grow your own organic vegetables or support a local, sustainable farm. Choose in-season ingredients to reduce costs, as storing food beyond its growing season can be resource-intensive. By supporting local farmers, you not only benefit your health but also contribute to your local economy.

One-fifth of the food that is produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally. This loss and waste generates up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions—nearly five times that of the aviation sector. To help reduce waste, try buying only what you’ll eat before it spoils, composting your scraps, and freezing or preserving anything you won’t use immediately. There are also many other effective ways to reduce waste beyond just your diet!

Raising livestock for human consumption generates around 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions—more than all transportation emissions combined. Still feel like you need animal protein to feel your best? Try limiting your consumption of meat and dairy products to just a few days a week. Whenever possible, choose more sustainable options, such as sustainably produced chicken instead of beef, to reduce your environmental impact.

Plant-based proteins, such as beans, pulses, and certain grains, are far less resource-intensive than animal proteins like beef and chicken. They are also heart-healthy and easier to digest. For a delicious, sustainable alternative, try swapping lentils for beef in dishes like tacos or shepherd’s pie—it's a flavorful and filling option that you might just love!

What makes a food item sustainable?
According to the World Health Organization’s Guiding Principles on Sustainable Healthy Diet, to eat sustainably is to ‘promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and wellbeing; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable.’

So, to eat sustainably not only looks at the environmental impact of a food item, but its impact on society, culture, and our bodies.

Here are 10 sustainable foods to eat, and why they’re good for us, and for the planet.

top 10 sustainable foods to eat
1. Pulses
Pulses like lentils, chickpeas and beans are rich in protein and fibre. They also have the ability to ‘self-fertilise’ soil, reducing the need for artificial fertilisers & don’t use as much land as animal proteins.

Did you know it takes 100 times more land to produce a gram of animal protein (such as beef or lamb) versus pulses such as peas? 

2. Leafy Greens
Dark, leafy greens such as kale, spinach, watercress & broccoli are some of the most versatile and nutritious of all vegetables. Not only are they rich in antioxidants, they have also been linked to lowering the risk of heart disease and diabetes.

They’re planet-friendly because they grow fast (meaning multiple harvests a year), and have low carbon emissions furing their growing and harvesting processes.

3. Cereals & Grains
The best way to incorporate cereals and grains into our diets is by having a variety. The WWF warns that ‘there is a pressing need to vary the types of cereals and grains grown and eaten.’  This is because monoculture (only growing one principal crop e.g. wheat) has a major impact on soil health due to a higher risk of diseases and, therefore a higher use of chemical pesticides to combat these from spreading. These chemicals are just as detrimental to human health as they are to soil health!

Additionally, the more we diversify what we’re growing, the greater the range of vitamins and minerals that can be incorporated into our diet. Try spelt, buckwheat, teff and quinoa to diversify your grain intake and improve your gut health.

4. Oats
Oats are pretty incredible. They thrive in inhospitable places, such as high altitudes, and can be sown between other crop harvests to replenish the soil. They help lower cholesterol and blood pressure and have a lot of fibre.

Did you know oat milk uses a lot less water than other plan alternatives, too, such as soy or rice milk?

5. Mussels
Mussels are so nutrient-dense, experts say they could be one of the best ways we can feed a growing population.

Did you know mussels also help to clean up the oceans as they feed by filtering water? In the process, they remove waste particles, industrial fertilisers and CO2!

6. Seaweed
Algae, including seaweed, produces around 50% of all oxygen on earth. It can also absorb CO2, nitrogen & phosphate in the sea and can be harvested several times a year! It’s high in omega 3, vitamins and antioxidants and has a strong Umami flavour.

7. Mushrooms
Fungi are rich in nutrients such as B & D vitamins. Apparently, a KG of mushrooms produces less than 0.7 KG of CO2 and need less water and energy than most other agricultural crops.

8. Local Fruit
The further a food has to travel, the greater its carbon footprint. Only 7% of the fruits we eat in the UK are grown here! Try to eat what’s in season and freeze gluts of fresh fruit in the summer.

9. Figs
A whopping 1,300 bird and mammals eat figs, making them one of the most relied-on fruits on the planet! Planting fig trees can help to regenerate deforested landscapes, restore biodiversity and the trees are resilient to climate change.

10. Grass-fed beef
You might be thinking: ‘this can’t be right? Beef, a sustainable food?’ Some research shows that grass-fed beef can be carbon-negative in the short term, and carbon-neutral in the long term. Natural fertiliser produced by cows reduces or eliminates the need for chemical fertilisers, and the hooves churn up the soil which helps it to absorb more carbon.

Travelling is a wonderful opportunity to discover new cultures, reconnect with nature, stretch our boundaries and unwind. However, there is more to travel than meets the eye. With travelling comes the responsibility to preserve and protect the environments we visit so we can continue to enjoy them for years to come.

With the number of threats our environment faces today - it's easy to feel overwhelmed when it comes to responsible travel. Yet, you may be surprised how easy it is to minimise your impact and contribute to the environment in a positive way. To help you get started, we've created 10 simple steps taken from our Responsible Travel Guidebook.

1. Choose Carbon-Free Transport
Self-propelled modes of transport are not only good for you, but they are also good for the environment too! They are a great way to get fit and reduce your footprint. Whether you like walking, cycling or kayaking – they are all excellent ways to slow down and immerse yourself in the area you are visiting with minimal impact.

2. Avoid Single Use Plastic Bottles
It’s a well-known fact that single-use plastic bottles are a problem for our planet, particularly in countries with no recycling systems in place. To reduce your impact, travel with a reusable drink bottle and fill up at potable water stations or use water purification tablets. There are also UV water purification drink bottles on the market too.

3. Leave No Trace
Help protect the long-term health of our natural world by practising the 7 Principals of 'Leave No Trace' whenever you are travelling through wilderness areas.

Plan ahead and prepare
Travel and camp on durable surfaces
Dispose of waste properly
Leave what you find
Minimise campfire impacts
Respect wildlife
Be considerate of your hosts and other visitors
When in doubt - ‘take only photos and leave only footprints.’ Learn More

7. Consider the Welfare of Animals
Whether wild or domesticated, all animals are entitled to the universally accepted principles of animal welfare called the Five Freedoms:

Freedom from hunger or thirst
Freedom from discomfort
Freedom from pain, injury or disease
Freedom to express (most) normal behaviours
Freedom from fear and distress
Read our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct for a better idea of how you can ensure that your travels do not negatively impact all the beautiful creatures of the world.

8. Do Your Research
An informed traveller will make better decisions for the environment. We urge you to research the environmental issues faced by the destination you are visiting and commit to minimising the contribution you make to these problems.

9. Take a Direct Flight 
Minimise the carbon produced by your air travel by booking the most direct flight to your destination. After all, sometimes the savings of cheaper indirect flights are not really worth it once you add up hotel costs, airport lounges or expensive airport meals.  Even better, offset your air travel next time you travel to support sustainable energy projects through the South Pole. Find Out More

10. Choose Your Trip Carefully
Again, this comes down to doing your research. Look for substantial commitments to responsible travel, actual procedures and initiatives in place which make a positive impact on the local people and environment. Ensure that whoever you travel with has a proven commitment to responsible travel and the environment. 

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Avoid air travel when possible
Airplanes emit large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other pollutants into the atmosphere when they fly. These emissions contribute significantly to climate change and global warming, as well as local air pollution in areas near airports or flight paths. The amount of CO2 emitted depends on how far you fly and what type of aircraft you use –older planes tend to be less efficient than newer ones.

Travel close to home
Travel can be a powerful tool for positive change, but it's important to consider the impact our travels have on the environment. Traveling close to home is one way to reduce our carbon footprint while still enjoying meaningful experiences and connecting with nature. Not only will you save money, but you'll have the opportunity to explore your own culture from a different perspective and visit nearby communities in a more meaningful way.

Choose sustainable accommodation
Your choice of accommodation also plays an important role in reducing the environmental impact of tourism. Look for hotels that are certified green or eco-friendly - these often use renewable energy sources such as solar power, adopt sustainable practices such as water conservation initiatives, and may even offer locally sourced food in their restaurants or cafes. Staying in smaller guesthouses owned by locals can also help support local economies while minimizing your own environmental footprint during your trip.

Sustainability is a key factor in not just the business economy, but also education.


Energy efficiency is not as arduous as it sounds.

Turn off school lights and shut down your computers at the end of the day. Keep your classroom doors shut to stop heat escaping and do not block heaters. Check the energy consumption of your appliances and make it a major consideration when buying new ones and always purchase energy efficient light bulbs.

For creating environmentally friendly classrooms, make sure they are well insulated and use sustainable materials for repairs and re-building. These are all incremental steps which ensure overall sustainability in your school.

This will also encourage pupils to employ energy efficient behaviour in their day-to-day living, thus spreading the sustainability message beyond the classroom and into their own homes. It’s a useful follow-on lesson.

 Advocate zero waste at school events
When it comes to sustainable school grounds, don’t forget the events where not only your pupils attend, but the whole community leaves their larger green footprint.

Firstly, determine how much food you need to serve guests. Whether it’s a PTA meeting, a school disco or a football match, calculate to eliminate any food waste.

Always opt for packaging that is fully recyclable and made from recycled content. Also, look for items with the least amount of packaging, such as condiment dispensers over individual packets. Consider bulk purchases with compostable or easily recyclable wrappers, which will in turn be able to be reused in crafting activities (see tip #2 above).

Adopting a zero-waste policy (or as near as is possible) is also cost effective.

Sustainability, climate change, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) aren’t just trends in corporate culture these days. There are clear benefits for the bottomline and employee culture and retention.
McKinsey reports that  78 percent consumers prioritize sustainability and eco-friendly brands. And we’re seeing 89 percent of organizations with high ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) ratings outperform others in the market. In an era where both young professionals and experienced employees are looking for more meaning in their work, creating an eco-friendly office culture attracts potential talent and consumers. Company’s like Bob’s Red Mill and REI have strong environmental initiatives or are fair trade certified and have some of the strongest employee engagement. Your workplace has an opportunity to make a difference that not only instills a sense of purpose and camaraderie with your people, but it can benefit the planet too.

Delete old emails and digital files
Did you know that emails are responsible for a large amount of CO2 emissions? Email centers and data centers storing our files and helping us send that “checking-in email” need a lot of electricity to run. According to Science Focus magazine, emails have a global carbon footprint of approximately seven million cars!

Encourage your people to review their inboxes and those old emails or digitally stored files. It’s energy saving and frees up your devices, extending their life!

It’s not enough to simply power down your devices before leaving — power is still being consumed if it’s plugged in. Phantom power, or standby power, can become a huge, unnecessary expense for your company if left unaddressed.

Don’t let phantom power haunt you — remember to unplug your workstation before leaving the office.

Keep an eye on the thermostat, especially in the summer
Even in the warmer, summer months, it’s fairly common to see office-dwellers wearing sweatshirts and jackets.

Instead of keeping the office as cold as the company fridge, try starting your air conditioning system at 72 degrees. If your workplace is still comfortable at this level, try going up another degree or two.

The higher your thermostat reads in the summer months, the more energy — and money — you’ll save in the long run.

Go paperless
This tip almost seems trivial given the digital age we now live in. From cloud storage services to digital pay stubs, the need for paper and printers in the workplace has rapidly decreased in the past two decades. Diminish the temptation to print by reducing the number of printers in your office and donating them to a local school or non-profit organization in need.

As a student or remote worker you should attempt to go digital as far as possible. This will involve using cloud storage and online platforms. Apps help you to store your documents, access them, and share them. Technology can help you to be more eco-friendly. Online calendars, note-taking apps, etc. prevent paper wastage. An eco-friendly study space helps to promote effective learning because it is generally tidier, and more organized.
