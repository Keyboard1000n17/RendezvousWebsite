What It Means to Be Environmentally Friendly

Being eco friendly means living in a way that is not harmful to the environment. This way of life is becoming increasingly important, as we must protect our planet from damage that we cause. Many ways in various areas are there for an individual to make sustainable changes to decrease the negative effects our daily lives usually contribute to.

The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> continues to issue severe warnings of the failure of governments and systems to suitably react to the rapidly changing climate, which continues to rip through the poorest areas of the world, displacing more than 20 million people each year and intensifying global supply-demand dynamics.

The seismic shift required to circumvent further worsening of the effects of climate change will require action from individuals on a community level. This could include energy-based home improvements or reducing over-consumption. Currently, emissions from consumption in high-income cities are set to double by 2050. This must be urgently reduced by two-thirds by 2030 to ensure the health and happiness of future generations.

This website spans various areas of your life where you can change your routines and reconsider your engagement with the systems around you. From small energy efficiency measures to energy system upgrades, from realising your purchasing power to adopting eco tourism habits. Making a start and having an awareness of personal changes that you can make can contribute towards system change and improve your local community.

It is possible to be eco friendly in various areas of our lives.

Here's a quick list of how to be eco-friendly if one doesn't want to spend too long browsing here, but these tips are quite general.

Use LED lighting throughout your home. 
Use more public transport. 
Wash your clothes less often.
Eat less meat.
Limit plane travel.

“It’s easy to be cynical about the impact our individual actions can have on reducing climate change,” says Dave Publicover, AMC’s senior staff scientist. “After all, all of us support and use the products of power plants and factories (the produce most of the greenhouse gas emissions). But individual actions and choices, when multiplied by millions of households, can collectively have a major impact.”

<!--Note-->Note: Energy Star is a programme initiated by the United States Environmental Agency. Learn more about them on their <a href="https://www.energystar.gov">website</a>

There are many ways to save energy in your home so you will not only enjoy lower energy bills but also increased comfort with fewer drafts and a good feeling that you are making energy choices that count for the environment, your family and future generations.

You can search up for more information on these. <!--temp-->


Air Seal & Insulate
Sealing and insulating is often the most cost effective way to improve efficiency and comfort. Sealing air leaks around your home and adding insulation can help your home be more comfortable and energy efficient and provide up to a 10% savings on your annual energy bills. Simple fixes include installing weather stripping on doors and caulking (seal a gap with caulk, a waterproof filler and sealant) used in building work and repairs around windows, while bigger jobs might include sealing leaks and adding insulation in your attic.

Heat & Cool Efficiently
Almost half of all household energy use goes towards heating and cooling. So making smart decisions about your home's heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system can have a big effect on your utility bills — and your comfort. To increase the efficiency of your heating and cooling system, you can:
	-Change your air filter regularly
	-Tune up your HVAC equipment yearly
	-Install a smart thermostat
	-Seal your heating and cooling ducts
	-Consider installing ENERGY STAR certified heating and cooling equipment
	-Ask about Proper Installation of your new equipment

Open gaps and seams, called air leaks, allow cold or warm air from outside to enter your home through window frames, exterior doors, uninsulated rim joists, your attic, and more. Air sealing fixes this issue. Along with insulation, air sealing is one of the most important things you can do to improve your home’s comfort, health, and energy efficiency—but it’s often overlooked by both homeowners and even some contractors. Air sealing is the process of locating—and then sealing—all the nooks, crannies, gaps, and open seams throughout your home. A professionally-sealed home will have well-regulated air flow — it’ll be less stuffy in summer and less drafty in winter. Air sealing can also improve your home’s overall air quality, reduce humidity in your house, increase the health and comfort of your home, reduce the energy used by your heating and cooling equipment and lower your energy bills.

In houses with forced-air heating and cooling systems, ducts are used to distribute conditioned air throughout the house. In a typical house, however, about 20 to 30 percent of the air that moves through the duct system is lost due to leaks, holes, and poorly connected ducts. The result is higher utility bills and difficulty keeping the house comfortable, no matter how the thermostat is set.

How do you know that your home has poorly performing ducts?

you have high summer and winter utility bills;
you have rooms that are difficult to heat and cool;
you have stuffy rooms that never seem to feel comfortable;
your ducts are located in an attic, crawlspace, or the garage;
you find tangled or kinked flexible ducts in your system.

A duct system that is well-designed and properly sealed can make your home more comfortable, energy efficient, and safer.

Comfort: Sealing and insulating ducts can help with common comfort problems, such as rooms that are too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter.

Indoor air quality: Fumes from household and garden chemicals, insulation particles, and dust can enter your duct system, aggravating asthma and allergy problems. Sealing ducts can help improve indoor air quality by reducing the risk of pollutants entering ducts and circulating through your home.

Safety: During normal operation, gas appliances such as water heaters, clothes dryers, and furnaces release combustion gases (like carbon monoxide) through their ventilation systems. Leaky ductwork in your heating and cooling system may cause “backdrafting,” where these gases are drawn back into the living space, rather than expelled to the outdoors. Sealing leaks can minimize this risk.

Save money: Leaky ducts can reduce heating and cooling system efficiency by as much as 20 percent. Sealing and insulating ducts increases efficiency, lowers your energy bills, and can often pay for itself in energy savings. Plus, if you’re planning to install new heating and cooling equipment, a well-designed and sealed duct system may allow you to downsize to a smaller, less costly heating and cooling system that will provide better dehumidification.

Protect the environment: Energy used in our homes often comes from the burning of fossil fuels at power plants, which contributes to smog, acid rain, and climate change. Simply put, the less energy we use in our homes, the less air pollution we generate. By sealing your ducts and reducing the amount of energy necessary to comfortably heat or cool your home, you can reduce the amount of air pollution generated.

Sealing ducts can also help improve the indoor air quality by reducing the risks of pollutants entering ducts from dusty attics or musty crawlspaces and circulating through your home. Dust from insulation particles or smells from damp spaces could aggravate asthma and allergy problems.

Peace of Mind: The less energy you use in your home,
the less air pollution is produced. By sealing your ducts
and reducing the amount of energy necessary to
comfortably heat or cool your home, you can have the peace of
mind that you’ve done the right thing for your family, home, and
for the planet.
