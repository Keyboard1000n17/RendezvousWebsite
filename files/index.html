		<span id="heading" style="text-align: right;">What It Means to Be Environmentally Friendly</span>

		<p>Being eco friendly means living in a way that is not harmful to the environment. This way of life is becoming increasingly important, as we must protect our planet from damage that we cause. Many ways are there for an individual to make sustainable changes to decrease the negative effects our daily lives usually contribute to. It is possible to be eco friendly in various areas of our lives.</p>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" color="white">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> continues to issue severe warnings of the failure of governments and systems to suitably react to the rapidly changing climate, which continues to rip through the poorest areas of the world, displacing more than 20 million people each year and intensifying global supply-demand dynamics.</p>

		<p>The seismic shift required to circumvent further worsening of the effects of climate change will require action from individuals on a community level. This could include energy-based home improvements or reducing over-consumption. Currently, emissions from consumption in high-income cities are set to double by 2050. This must be urgently reduced by two-thirds by 2030 to ensure the health and happiness of future generations.</p>

		<p>“It’s easy to be cynical about the impact our individual actions can have on reducing climate change,” says Dave Publicover, AMC’s senior staff scientist. “After all, all of us support and use the products of power plants and factories (the produce most of the greenhouse gas emissions). But individual actions and choices, when multiplied by millions of households, can collectively have a major impact.”</p>
