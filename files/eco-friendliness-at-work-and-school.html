		<p>Sustainability is a key factor in not just the business economy, but also education. Education is at the heart of our society, and it is worthwhile exploring just how schools can embrace this positive change. In an era where both young professionals and experienced employees are looking for more meaning in their work, creating an eco-friendly office culture attracts potential talent and consumers. Companies like Bob’s Red Mill and REI have strong environmental initiatives or are fair trade certified and have some of the strongest employee engagement. Your workplace or school has an opportunity to make a difference that not only instills a sense of purpose and camaraderie with your people, but it can benefit the planet too.</p>
		<p>We can be eco-friendly at our workplaces or schools in a few ways.</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary class="level-one">Go paperless</summary>
			<p>A lot of paper is printed in an office space. It’s unavoidable that paper will be printed, whether it’s for a meeting or to sign a contract. However, printing out a document may not be entirely necessary. From cloud storage services to digital pay stubs, the need for paper and printers in the workplace has rapidly decreased in the past two decades. Diminish the temptation to print by reducing the number of printers in your office and donating them to a local school or non-profit organization in need.</p>
			<p>The best thing you could do is to think if it is required to have a document in hard copy. If not, you could consider sending it via email. To minimise their carbon footprint, contracts can be sent and signed digitally.</p>
			<p>As a student or remote worker you should attempt to go digital as far as possible. This will involve using cloud storage and online platforms. Apps help you to store your documents, access them, and share them. Technology can help you to be more eco-friendly. Online calendars, note-taking apps, etc. prevent paper wastage. An eco-friendly study space helps to promote effective learning because it is generally tidier, and more organized. </p>

			<summary class="level-one">Encourage Public Transportation for Employees</summary>
			<p>Depending on the distance from the employee’s home to the workplace, there are different ways to commute to work. While using a car may seem the easiest and fastest option, taking the train or bus would pollute less. You could ride a bicycle to work depending on your city's biking infrastructure.</p>
		</details><br>
		
		<details>
			<summary class="level-one">Delete old emails and digital files</summary>
			<p>Did you know that emails are responsible for a large amount of CO2 emissions? Email centers and data centers storing our files and helping us send that “checking-in email” need a lot of electricity to run. According to Science Focus magazine, emails have a global carbon footprint of approximately seven million cars! Encourage your people to review their inboxes and those old emails or digitally stored files. It’s energy saving and frees up your devices, extending their life! It also declutters your email. Once you start doing it, do it regularly.</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Encourage the Mantra ‘Reduce, Reuse, Recycle’</summary>
			<p>These three well-known waste management principles will make your office more eco friendly. Obvious? Maybe. But it helps. Offices should set up different containers for different types of products. Use recycling bins for paper, plastic, and soft drink cans rather than throwing everything out in one bin.</p>
		</details><br>

			<summary class="level-one">Use electricity wisely</summary>
			<p>Offices naturally require electricity to power their equipment, amenities, and facilities. However, knowing about energy consumption and what is required is important. Companies could contribute to a greener office by ensuring that electric devices are plugged off when not in use. It's good to stay aware of energy consumption and to make changes when the usage is predicted to go above the limit set for the month. Moreover, an increasing number of large tech corporations are using green energy to meet their electricity needs. Turn off lights when not required. Use natural sunlight. It reduces carbon emissions. Also, unplug devices (NOT put them on standby!). It’s not enough to simply power down your devices before leaving - power is still being consumed if it’s plugged in. Phantom power, or standby power, can become a huge, unnecessary expense for your company if left unaddressed. Don’t let phantom power haunt you - remember to unplug your workstation before leaving the office. Turn off school lights and shut down your computers at the end of the day. Keep your classroom doors shut to stop heat escaping and do not block heaters. Check the energy consumption of your appliances and make it a major consideration when buying new ones and always purchase energy efficient light bulbs. For creating environmentally friendly classrooms, make sure they are well insulated and use sustainable materials for repairs and re-building. These are all incremental steps which ensure overall sustainability in your school. This will also encourage pupils to employ energy efficient behaviour in their day-to-day living, thus spreading the sustainability message beyond the classroom and into their own homes. It’s a useful follow-on lesson.</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Keep an eye on the thermostat, especially in the summer</summary>
			<p>Even in the warmer, summer months, it’s fairly common to see office-dwellers wearing sweatshirts and jackets. Instead of keeping the workplace as cold as the company fridge, try starting your air conditioning system at 72 degrees. If your workplace is still comfortable at this level, try going up another degree or two. The higher your thermostat reads in the summer months, the more energy - and money - you’ll save in the long run.</p>

			<summary class="level-one"> Advocate zero waste at school events</summary>
			<p>When it comes to sustainable school grounds, don’t forget the events where not only your pupils attend, but the whole community leaves their larger green footprint. Firstly, determine how much food you need to serve guests. Whether it’s a PTA meeting, a school disco or a football match, calculate to eliminate any food waste. Always opt for packaging that is fully recyclable and made from recycled content. Also, look for items with the least amount of packaging, such as condiment dispensers over individual packets. Consider bulk purchases with compostable or easily recyclable wrappers, which will in turn be able to be reused in crafting activities (see tip #2 above). Adopting a zero-waste policy (or as near as is possible) is also cost effective.</p>
