		<p>Travelling is a wonderful opportunity to discover new cultures, reconnect with nature, stretch our boundaries and unwind. However, there is more to travel than meets the eye. With travelling comes the responsibility to preserve and protect the environments we visit so we can continue to enjoy them for years to come.</p>
		<p>With the number of threats our environment faces today - it's easy to feel overwhelmed when it comes to responsible travel. Yet, you may be surprised how easy it is to minimise your impact and contribute to the environment in a positive way. We can be eco-friendly while travelling in a number of ways.</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary class="level-one">Choose carbon-free transport</summary>
			<p>Carbon neutral travel is a way to reduce your carbon footprint and make a positive difference in the world while having life-changing experiences. Travelers can contribute to carbon neutrality by avoiding air travel when possible, traveling close to home, choosing greener airlines, offsetting flight emissions, and more. You can also start by choosing low-carbon transportation options to get to your host, such as public transport, biking, or walking. Self-propelled modes of transport are not only good for you, but they are also good for the environment too! They are a great way to get fit and reduce your footprint. Whether you like walking, cycling or kayaking – they are all excellent ways to slow down and immerse yourself in the area you are visiting with minimal impact.</p>
			<p>Avoid air travel when possible. Airplanes emit large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and other pollutants into the atmosphere when they fly. These emissions contribute significantly to climate change and global warming, as well as local air pollution in areas near airports or flight paths. The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted depends on how far you fly and what type of aircraft you use –older planes tend to be less efficient than newer ones.</p>
			<p>Travel close to home. Travel can be a powerful tool for positive change, but it's important to consider the impact our travels have on the environment. Traveling close to home is one way to reduce our carbon footprint while still enjoying meaningful experiences and connecting with nature. Not only will you save money, but you'll have the opportunity to explore your own culture from a different perspective and visit nearby communities in a more meaningful way.</p>
			<p>Choose sustainable accommodation. Your choice of accommodation also plays an important role in reducing the environmental impact of tourism. Look for hotels that are certified green or eco-friendly - these often use renewable energy sources such as solar power, dopt sustainable practices such as water conservation initiatives, and may even offer locally sourced food in their restaurants or cafes. Staying in smaller guesthouses owned by locals can also help support local economies while minimizing your own environmental footprint during your trip.</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Avoid cruise holidays</summary>
			<p>Cruise holidays have become increasingly popular. However, these big ships contribute massively to GHG emissions. Carnival Corporation's fleet of 47 cruise ships emits 10 times more sulphur oxides (SOx) than 100 million cars. It is important to be aware of your holiday's footprint on the environment and opt for more sustainable holidays when possible.</p>
			<p>Cruise ships impact the environment in several ways, from the air pollution they emit to the waste they generate. A critical issue is dumping sewage and wastewater into the ocean, which can harm marine life and ecosystems. These floating cities of leisure and luxury have long been celebrated for their ability to offer a unique travel experience. However, beneath the surface of these grand voyages lies a less talked-about truth: their significant environmental impact. Cruise ships are known to be heavy carbon emitters. A medium-sized cruise ship emits greenhouse gases equivalent to those of 12,000 cars, and it could dump over 1 billion gallons of untreated sewage into the ocean. For instance, during the six-month cruise season, a ship sailing from Seattle to Alaska emitted 1.1 million tons of CO2 to 559,414 passengers. This data indicates that the cruise industry can generate more than a million tonnes of garbage annually. </p>

			<summary class="level-one">Practice Sustainable Tourism</summary>
			<p>Following the pandemic, people have become more aware of their cultural, economic and environmental impacts as tourists, with 72% of people surveyed by Booking.com admitting that they think sustainable travel is vital.</p>
			<p>Increasingly, people are engaging more in sustainable tourism, which involves limiting their carbon footprint while travelling, being tactical with their spending power and helping sustain the natural environment they have the privilege to visit. This helps prevent over-tourism, which is the overcrowding of tourist destinations that disrupts the local way of life through the rise in housing and renting costs and the commodification of local traditions.</p>
			<p>Pollution, especially through excess waste, leads to the degradation of natural or archaeological sites and the depletion of natural resources, including water, soil nutrients and biodiversity.</p>
			<p>Below are just some eco-tourism tips to consider for your next trip:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reusable Bottle</li>
				<li>Choose tour operators that invest in the local communities where they conduct their business.</li>
				<li>Travel off-season.</li>
				<li>Choose less tourist-heavy locations.</li>
				<li>Don’t litter.</li>
				<li>Use public transport as much as possible.</li>
				<li>Stick to footpaths.</li>
				<li>Use reusable containers and bottles rather than disposable paper plates, cutlery and cups.</li>
				<li>Limit your energy use in accommodation such as by taking shorter showers, reducing air-conditioning use.</li>
				<li>Spend in local shops and restaurants.</li>
				<li>Use Environmentally Friendly Travel Products.</li>

			<summary class="level-one">Green Key Certified Accommodation</summary>
			
			<p>Looking for the most sustainable places in their business is important when looking for accommodation abroad. Selecting Green Key-certified accommodation is one way to do that. To be Green Key certified, 13 criteria need to be fulfilled. Being Green Key certified means that the accommodation respects local cultures and traditions, takes care of the environment and treats its employees fairly. You can learn more about Green Key certification at their <a href="https://www.greenkey.global/criteria">website</a></p>
			<p>These 13 criteria are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Environmental Management</li>
				<li>Staff involvement</li>
				<li>Green activities</li>
				<li>Indoor environment</li>
				<li>Guest information</li>
				<li>Green areas</li>
				<li>Corporate social responsibility</li>
				<li>Energy</li>
				<li>Food and beverages</li>
				<li>Water</li>
				<li>Cleaning and washing</li>
				<li>Waste</li>
				<li>Administration</li>

			<summary class="level-one">Other simple ways to be eco-friendly while travelling</summary>
			<ul>
				<li style="list-style-type: none; font-weight: 600;">Unplug Before Travelling</li>
				<p>Even if electronic devices are shut off or in sleep mode, they still use energy. Being away for too long wastes energy that could otherwise have been plugged off. So, before going on vacation, unplug your devices from the wall sockets to save electricity.</p>

				<li style="list-style-type: none; font-weight: 600;">Pack Light</li>
				<p>Flying to foreign destinations will emit emissions no matter what. However, if flying is the only option, then travellers can try to pack light to minimise pollution. The more luggage a plane carries on its travels, the more fuel the aeroplane needs to fly.</p>

				<li style="list-style-type: none; font-weight: 600;">Give Away Perishable Food Items before Travelling</li>
				<p>Before leaving for vacation, check if any food item in the fridge is about to expire. If possible, consume it before the expiry date; otherwise, donate it to needy people and avoid food wastage.</p>
