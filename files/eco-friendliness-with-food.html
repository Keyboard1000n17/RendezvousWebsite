		<p>What we eat has changed the planet. Across the globe forests have been devastated to make space to rear cattle and to grow crops to feed livestock, while our oceans become barren as they are trawled and overfished. Food production is not only the greatest driver of wildlife loss, it contributes to climate change: about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food. The food you eat has a bigger environmental impact than you might think, but by adopting a sustainable eating plan, you can make a big difference. Your diet is a personal choice, but cooking sustainable meals can be both simple and delicious.</p>
		<p>So, we can become more eco-friendly by doing a few simple things -</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary class="level-one">Shop for local produce</summary>
			<p>The average item of fresh food travels 1,500 miles before we buy it. These carbon-heavy value chains create emissions through transport, refrigeration and production processes. You can eliminate this by buying from local producers where you can. A well-established local food economy strengthens supply chains, meaning there are more supply options during shortages. Local, seasonal produce also has higher nutritional value since it has spent less time from its source. Meanwhile, international produce is grown to artificially exceed its natural shelf life, compromising its nutritional value. You can also grow your own organic vegetables or support a local, sustainable farm. Choose in-season ingredients to reduce costs, as storing food beyond its growing season can be resource-intensive. By supporting local farmers, you not only benefit your health but also contribute to your local economy.</p>
			<p>In Qatar, this is very simple. Due to the 2017 blockade of Qatar, local institutions have been set up to continue providing Qatar with daily products people need. For example, Baladna was founded as a sheep and goat farm in 2014, which quickly expanded into mass production in 2017. Dandy is a company providing dairy products since 1973. <!--Source: My yoghurt in the fridge-->They have products that are quite prominent in the dairy aisles of any store, be it a small supermarket in the neighbourhood 0r in Carrefour in Ezdan mall!</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Limit and reduce your waste</summary>
			<p>Food waste is a big problem. One-fifth of the food that is produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally. This loss and waste generates up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions - nearly five times that of the aviation sector. In fact, if food waste was a country it would be the 3rd largest emitter of greenhouse gasses after China and the USA. Reducing waste in your household is simple: freeze anything you can’t eat while it’s fresh and, where possible, buy loose produce so you can select the exact amount that you need. To help reduce waste, try buying only what you’ll eat before it spoils, composting your scraps, and freezing or preserving anything you won’t use immediately. You can also limit your household food waste by portioning your meals reasonably, only buying what you need and using food waste as fertiliser for soil and plants.</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Eat more plants and less meat</summary>
			<p>Farming animals for meat and dairy requires space and huge amounts of water and feed. Raising livestock for human consumption alone generates around 15% of total global greenhouse gas emissions - more than all transportation emissions combined. Try limiting your consumption of meat and dairy products to just a few days a week - it helps. Global meat consumption has soared 500% between 1992 and 2016, making it clear we need to rebalance our diets by prioritising plants and moderating our intake of animal products. It is not necessary that we all go vegetarian or vegan, that's what we have cows and sheeps and goats for. Just reducing how much we eat them is enough. Plant-based proteins, such as beans, pulses, and certain grains, are far less resource-intensive than animal proteins like beef and chicken. They are also heart-healthy and easier to digest. For a delicious, sustainable alternative, try lentils instead of beef in dishes like tacos or shepherd’s pie. Just try it, once, and see how it is.</p>

		<h2>What makes food sustainable?</h2>
		<p>According to the World Health Organization’s Guiding Principles on Sustainable Healthy Diet, to eat sustainably is to ‘promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and wellbeing; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable.’ So, to eat sustainably not only looks at the environmental impact of a food item, but its impact on society, culture, and our bodies.</p>
		
		<details>
			<summary class="level-one">Here are 10 sustainable foods to eat, and why they’re good for us, and for the planet.</summary>
			<p>By the way, click on the headings for more information about a particular food item. They are links to other webpages.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://pulses.org/what-are-pulses">Pulses</a></li>
				<p>Pulses like lentils, chickpeas and beans are rich in protein and fibre. They also have the ability to ‘self-fertilise’ soil, reducing the need for artificial fertilisers &amp don’t use as much land as animal proteins.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_vegetable">Leafy Greens</a></li>
				<p>Dark, leafy greens such as kale, spinach, watercress &amp broccoli are some of the most versatile and nutritious of all vegetables. Not only are they rich in antioxidants, they have also been linked to lowering the risk of heart disease and diabetes. They’re planet-friendly because they grow fast (meaning multiple harvests a year), and have low carbon emissions furing their growing and harvesting processes.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal">Cereals &amp Grains</a></li>
				<p>The best way to incorporate cereals and grains into our diets is by having a variety. The WWF warns that ‘there is a pressing need to vary the types of cereals and grains grown and eaten.’  This is because monoculture (only growing one principal crop e.g. wheat) has a major impact on soil health due to a higher risk of diseases and, therefore a higher use of chemical pesticides to combat these from spreading. These chemicals are just as detrimental to human health as they are to soil health. Additionally, the more we diversify what we’re growing, the greater the range of vitamins and minerals that can be incorporated into our diet. Try spelt, buckwheat, teff and quinoa to diversify your grain intake and improve your gut health.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oat">Oats</a></li>
				<p>Oats are pretty incredible. They thrive in inhospitable places, such as high altitudes, and can be sown between other crop harvests to replenish the soil. They help lower cholesterol and blood pressure and have a lot of fibre. Oat milk uses a lot less water than other plant alternatives such as soy or rice milk.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel">Mussels</a></li>
				<p>Mussels are so nutrient-dense, experts say they could be one of the best ways we can feed a growing population. Mussels also help clean up the oceans as they feed by filtering water. In the process, they remove waste particles, industrial fertilisers and CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed">Seaweed</a></li>
				<p>Algae, including seaweed, produces around 50% of all oxygen on earth. It can also absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrogen &amp phosphate in the sea and can be harvested several times a year! It’s high in omega 3, vitamins and antioxidants and has a strong Umami flavour.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom">Mushrooms</a></li>
				<p>Fungi are rich in nutrients such as B &amp D vitamins. Apparently, a KG of mushrooms produces less than 0.7 KG of CO<sub>2</sub> and need less water and energy than most other agricultural crops.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit">Local Fruit</a></li>
				<p>The further a food has to travel, the greater its carbon footprint. Only 7% of the fruits we eat in the UK are grown here! Try to eat what’s in season and freeze gluts of fresh fruit in the summer.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig">Figs</a></li>
				<p>A whopping 1,300 bird and mammals eat figs, making them one of the most relied-on fruits on the planet! Planting fig trees can help to regenerate deforested landscapes, restore biodiversity and the trees are resilient to climate change.</p>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef">Grass-fed beef</a></li>
				<p>You might be thinking: ‘this can’t be right? Beef, a sustainable food?’ Some research shows that grass-fed beef can be carbon-negative in the short term, and carbon-neutral in the long term. Natural fertiliser produced by cows reduces or eliminates the need for chemical fertilisers, and the hooves churn up the soil which helps it to absorb more carbon.</p>
