		<p>As consumers, we often find ourselves entangled in a web of fleeting styles where the pursuit of quantity overshadows the importance of quality. This relentless pursuit leads to overflowing closets, paradoxically leaving us feeling like we have ‘nothing to wear.’ However, a transformative shift in perspective towards valuing the intrinsic worth and longevity of clothing can bring about significant change.</p>

		<p>Opting for quality over quantity results in versatile and stylish wardrobes and aligns with sustainability and economic sensibility. This conscious approach promotes thoughtful consumption, reduces waste, and fosters a more symbiotic relationship with our garments.How we shop and care for our clothing is one of many ways we can we can reduce our carbon footprints and protect our water sources, the earth, and the public health. Here are some tips to green your wardrobe and be stylishly environmentally-friendly.</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Second-Hand Shopping</summary>
			<p>Shopping second-hand is one of the easiest ways to reduce the impact clothes have on the environment. When we purchase second-hand clothing and accessories, we reduce the demand for new clothing. This reduces the resources, pesticides, and fertilizers needed to produce it. As a result, carbon emissions and pollution decrease. </p>

			<p>Buying second-hand clothing can also save money, allow you to find unique pieces, and support local communities by purchasing from second-hand stores or organizations, such as <a href="https://www.housingworks.org/">Housing Works</a>, which contributes to important causes like fighting AIDS, homelessness, and social justice. In Qatar, you can't find physical stores that sell second-hand clothing, but you can find used clothing online on paces like Facebook Marketplace, Qatar Living, OLX Qatar, and more. So, next time you need to update your wardrobe, consider shopping second-hand and make a positive impact on the environment and your community.</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Sell or donate your used clothing</summary>
			<p>Do you have a closet full of clothes that you no longer wear? Instead of throwing them away, consider selling or donating them to give your wardrobe a second chance at life. After all,  one person’s trash is another person's treasure. There are various options for selling clothing online, including Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Poshmark, and ThredUp. These online marketplaces allow you to list your clothes for sale and reach a broad audience of potential buyers. If you wish to donate though, there are TAYF containers on some streets where you can donate items to help the poor. They are also built in a way that nobody can try steal from the box without tools or cutting their arm off.</p>

			<summary class="level-one">Eco-Friendly Laundry</summary>
			<p>Laundry may not be at the forefront of your mind when considering sustainability though there are many ways to make your laundry habits more eco-friendly. Certain chemicals and energy used in traditional laundry practices can significantly impact the environment. One simple change is to switch to an eco-friendly detergent. These detergents are made from natural ingredients and are biodegradable, making them less harmful to the environment and your skin.</p>
			<p>Also, don't wash your clothes too often. Wear them for a day or two before serving them to the laundry basket. And buy clothing made with natural fabric fibers instead of synthetic fabrics.You’ll reduce the amount of microplastics in our water sources that come from synthetic fibers that shed during washes. This is because synthetic fabric (which is made of plastics and includes nylon and polyester) sheds microplastics in the washing machine that will reach the ocean. The ocean floor holds over 14 million tonnes of microplastics, and this number is still increasing, with textiles contributing 500,000 tonnes yearly. 16% of the microplastics released into the oceans come from washing these synthetic clothes. The toxic fibres degrade ecosystems and are ingested by sea life and, eventually, mammals, including humans.</p>
			<p>Another option is to use an organic dry cleaner. Many traditional dry cleaners use harsh chemicals. Organic dry cleaners use safer, non-toxic cleaning methods that are better for the environment and your health. Not only will you be reducing your environmental impact, but you'll also be supporting a more sustainable business.</p>
